# NLD_CFD

CFD simulation of cylinder in wind using atmospheric boundary layer wall functions and simpleFOAM solver. 

## Meshing

Standard blockmesh that gets adapted using SnappyHexMesh to incorporate cylinder. ExtrudeMesh to convert to 2D case.

```
blockMesh
surfaceFeatureExtract
snappyHexMesh.exe -overwrite
extrudeMesh.exe
```

## CFD Solver

simpleFOAM with RANS K-epsilon turbelence model

## Boundary conditions

atmBoundaryLayerInletVelocity at inlet
